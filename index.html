<h2>Research</h2>
<p> As AI continues to advance, it is imperative to address several challenges to ensure not only the widespread adoption but also the safe and efficient implementation of this technology. These challenges include the high cost of computation, the limited availability of high-quality labeled data, generalizability across domains, and the lack of transparency – specifically, the absence of explanations for how AI works. 
  My long-term research objective is to study the theoretical foundations of artificial
intelligence and design more principled and efficient algorithms for better, safer, and
more efficient AI applications. As part of my research, my interests cover the following areas: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Machine/Deep Learning</p>
</li>
<li><p>Learning Theory</p>
</li>
<li><p>High-dimensional Data Analysis</p>
</li>
<li><p>Spatio-temporal Data Analysis</p>
</li>
<li><p>Deep Reinforcement Learning</p>
</li>
<li><p>Probability and Statistical Inference</p>
</li>
</ul>  
  <p> My current research interests lie in parameter-efficient transfer learning with foundation models and sparse learning, especially for applications involving spatial-temporal data. </p>
