<h2>About me</h2>
<p> Kai Yang received the Ph.D. degree from Columbia University, USA. He has held various prestigious positions, including Technical Staff Member at Bell Laboratories, Alcatel-Lucent, USA; 
  Tech Lead at Futurewei Technologies, USA. Since 2011, he has also served as an adjunct faculty member at Columbia University.
   <br><br>
   Currently, he is a Distinguished Professor at Tongji University, Shanghai, China. 
   He holds over 20 patents and has been extensively published in leading IEEE journals and conferences. 
   His current research interests encompass big data analytics, wireless communications, and signal processing. 
   He has also served as a Technical Program Committee (TPC) member for numerous IEEE conferences.
   <br><br>
   He has received several prestigious awards, including the Eliahu Jury Award from Columbia University, 
   the Bell Laboratories Teamwork Award, the Huawei Technology Breakthrough Award, and the Huawei Future Star Award.
   From 2012 to 2014, he was the Vice-Chair of the IEEE ComSoc Multimedia Communications Technical Committee. 
   Additionally, he has held leadership roles such as Demo/Poster Co-Chair for IEEE INFOCOM, 
   Symposium Co-Chair for IEEE GLOBECOM, and Workshop Co-Chair for IEEE ICME. He currently serves 
   as an Editor for the IEEE Internet of Things Journal and the IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials, 
   and as a Guest Editor for the IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications.

<h2>Research</h2>
<p> As AI continues to advance, it is imperative to address several challenges to ensure not only the widespread adoption but also the safe and efficient implementation of this technology. These challenges include the high cost of computation, the limited availability of high-quality labeled data, generalizability across domains, and the lack of transparency â€“ specifically, the absence of explanations for how AI works. 
  My long-term research objective is to study the theoretical foundations of artificial
intelligence and design more principled and efficient algorithms for better, safer, and
more efficient AI applications. As part of my research, my interests cover the following areas: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Machine/Deep Learning</p>
</li>
<li><p>Learning Theory</p>
</li>
<li><p>High-dimensional Data Analysis</p>
</li>
<li><p>Spatio-temporal Data Analysis</p>
</li>
<li><p>Deep Reinforcement Learning</p>
</li>
<li><p>Probability and Statistical Inference</p>
</li>
</ul>  
  <p> My current research interests lie in parameter-efficient transfer learning with foundation models and sparse learning, especially for applications involving spatial-temporal data. </p>
<h2>Recent news</h2>
